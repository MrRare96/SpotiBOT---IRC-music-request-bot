SpotiBOT---IRC-music-request-bot
================================
Well this project is a bit dead for a while, since I do not stream much and my study just started, so dont expect updates anytime soon.

What is SpotiBOT:

It is trying to be an universal music request bot for multiple music platforms such as spotify, youtube, lastfm and more.
It can be used for streaming and such, but also for an online radio with request functions(i think, just thought of it).

Immediatly i have to give you my apologie for my very porely written code thats just a huge mess :), it was my first project in C# after making hello world XD. At first i made this bot in php, which is definately not suitable for this kind of programs(that has to loop and run continuesly), so I thought C# was the best way to go. I also have no idea which files need to be uploaded here for you guys to mess with it :S, so I am sorry if its incomplete. But the code is most of all copy and paste ready :). 

Requirements:

CHROME, yes you need google chrome for it to work, it uses a specific function that i only found in chrome for now.

Last time i tried to change/edit the code is almost 2 months ago, so I think I wont continue this project for now, but vacation is comming up, so I might do it actually.
